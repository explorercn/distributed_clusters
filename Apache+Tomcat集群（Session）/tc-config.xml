  <!-- This section contains settings that affect all clients that connect to the
       system.
       
       Note that while these settings are applied uniformly across all clients,
       this does not prevent you from applying different settings to specific
       clients. There are two ways of doing this:
       
       - 1. Certain parameters ('logs', below) undergo parameter expansion
       before being used by the client. This allows you to use predefined
       substitutions (such as '%h' for host), or a general one
       (%(myprop) to use the value of Java system property 'myprop'), for
       these values.
       2. Expansions are carried out in each client's JVM
       independently.  Parameter expansion is not done for values inside the
       <modules> element.
  -->
  <clients>
    
    <!-- Where should the client write its log files?
         
         This value undergoes parameter substitution before being used.
         Thus, a value like 'client-logs-%h' expands to
         'client-logs-banana' if running on host 'banana'.
         
         If this is a relative path, it is interpreted relative to
         the current working directory of the client (that is, the directory
         you were in when you started the program that uses Terracotta
         services). It is recommended that you specify an absolute
         path.
         
         Default: 'logs-%i', which places the logs in a directory relative
         to the directory you were in when you invoked the program that uses
         Terracotta services (your client), and calls that directory. For example,
         'logs-10.0.0.57' if the machine that the client is on has assigned IP
         address 10.0.0.57.
    -->
    <logs>logs-%i</logs>
    
  </clients>
